        I am a research scientist at Anthropic, where I started and lead the societal impacts team. 
        Prior to that, I was the founding research director at the Stanford Institute for Human 
        Centered AI (HAI). I did my PhD in Computational Neuroscience at NYU and obtained my BS 
        in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Berkeley. For fun, I surf, play 
        bass with my band, and read widely across the humanities and social sciences.
